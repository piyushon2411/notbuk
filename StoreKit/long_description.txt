NotBuk turns your New Tab into a clean, fast notebook.

Type, format, and paste content with headings, bold/italic/underline, and bullet lists. While you browse, select text (and images) and add it to your notes via the right‑click menu. Everything is saved locally on your device — no account and no server calls.

Highlights
- Clean editor: predictable paragraphs, headings (H1–H3), bullets, clear formatting
- Paste with formatting preserved (and safe)
- Append selection from any page, including images and links
- Dark theme (Material Design 3), accessible colors
- Keyboard shortcuts for Mac/Windows/Linux
- No data collected; notes never leave your device

Privacy
All notes are stored locally using Chrome storage. NotBuk does not collect or send any data.

Permissions explained
- storage: store your notes locally
- contextMenus: add “Add to Notbuk Tab” to the right‑click menu when text is selected
- activeTab + scripting: capture the selected HTML from the current page when you click the menu (user gesture required). No persistent content scripts, and no host permissions.

Support
If you have issues, include steps to reproduce and your Chrome/OS version.
